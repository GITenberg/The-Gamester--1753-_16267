<p><tt>This reprint of Edward Moore's <u>The</u> <u>Gamester</u> makes
available to students of eighteenth century literature a play which, whatever
its intrinsic merits, is historically important both as a vehicle for a
century of great actors and as a contribution to the development of middle-class
tragedy which had considerable influence on the Continent. <u>The</u>
<u>Gamester</u> was first presented at the Drury Lane Theatre February 7, 1753
with Garrick in the leading role, and ran for ten successive nights. Up to the
middle of the nineteenth century it remained a popular stock piece--John
Philip Kemble, Mrs. Siddons, Mrs. Barry, the Keans, Macready, and others
having distinguished themselves in it--and in America from 1754 to 1875 it
enjoyed even more performances than in England. (J.H. Caskey, <u>The</u>
<u>Life</u> <u>and</u> <u>Works</u> <u>of</u> <u>Edward</u> <u>Moore</u>,
96-99). Moore's middle-class tragedy is the only really successful attempt to
follow Lillo's decisive break with tradition in England in the eighteenth
century. His background, like Lillo's, was humble, religious, and mercantile.
The son of a dissenting pastor, Moore received his early education in
dissenters' academies, and then served an apprenticeship to a London
linen-draper. After a few years in Ireland as an agent for a merchant, Moore
returned to London to join a partnership in the linen trade. The partnership
was soon dissolved, and Moore turned to letters for a livelihood. Among his
works are <u>Fables</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>Female</u> <u>Sex</u> (1744)
which went through three editions, <u>The</u> <u>Foundling</u> (1748), a
successful comedy, and <u>Gil</u> <u>Blas</u> (1751), an unsuccessful comedy.
In 1753, with encouragement and some assistance from Garrick, he produced
<u>The</u> <u>Gamester</u>, upon which his reputation as a writer depends.</tt></p>

<p><tt>It is impossible, of course, to review here all the factors involved in
the development of middle-class tragedy in England in the eighteenth century.
However, certain aspects of that movement which concern Moore's immediate
predecessors and which have not been adequately recognized might be mentioned
briefly. Aside from Elizabethan and Jacobean attempts to give tragic
expression
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
to everyday human experience, historians have noted the efforts of Otway,
Southerne, and Rowe to lower the social level of tragedy; but in this period
middle-class problems and sentiments and domestic situations appear in
numerous tragedies, long-since forgotten, which in form, setting, and social
level present no startling deviations from traditional standards. Little or no
attention has been given to some of these obscure dramatists who in the midst
of the Collier controversy attempted to illustrate in tragedy the arguments
advanced in the third part of John Dennis's <u>The</u> <u>Usefulness</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Stage</u>, <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>Happiness</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Mankind</u>, <u>to</u> <u>Government</u>, <u>and</u> <u>to</u>
<u>Religion</u> (1698). Striving to demonstrate the usefulness of the stage,
these avowed reformers produced essentially domestic tragedies, by treating
such problems as filial obedience and marital fidelity in terms of orthodox
theology. The argument that the stage can be an adjunct of the pulpit is
widespread, and appears most explicitly in Hill's preface to his <u>Fatal</u>
<u>Extravagance</u> (1721), sometimes regarded as the first middle-class
tragedy in the eighteenth century, and in Lillo's dedication to <u>George</u>
<u>Barnwell</u> (1731). The line from these obscure dramatists at the turn of
the century to Lillo is direct and clear. Of these forgotten plays we can note
here only <u>Fatal</u> <u>Friendship</u> (1698) by Mrs. Catherine Trotter whom
John Hughes hailed as "the first of stage-reformers"</tt></p>

<p><tt>(<u>To</u> <u>the</u> <u>Author</u> <u>of</u> <u>Fatal</u> <u>Friendship</u>,
<u>a</u> <u>Tragedy</u>), an unquestionably domestic tragedy inculcating a
theological "lesson". To this play, which was acted with "great applause"
(<u>Biographica</u> <u>Dramatica</u>, 107), Aaron Hill was, I am convinced,
considerably indebted for his <u>Fatal</u> <u>Extravagance</u>, which is, in
turn, one of the sources of <u>The</u> <u>Gamester</u>.</tt></p>

<p><tt>In the early eighteenth century, then, there is clearly discernible a
two-fold tendency toward middle-class tragedy which reaches its fullest
expression in Lillo: the desire to lower the social level of the characters in
order to make the tragedy more moving; and the desire to defend the stage by
demonstrating its religious and moral utility. In his prologue to <u>The</u>
<u>Fair</u> <u>Penitent</u> (l703), Rowe gave expression to the first: the
"fate of kings and empires", he argues,
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
is too remote to engage our feelings, for "we ne'er can pity that we ne'er can
share"; therefore he offers "a melancholy tale of private woes". In his
prologue, Lillo repeats this idea, but in his dedication he shows himself
primarily concerned with the second tendency. Specifically challenging those
"who deny the lawfulness of the stage", he argues that "the more extensively
useful the moral of any tragedy is, the more excellent that piece must be of
its kind"; the generality of mankind is more liable to vice than are kings;
therefore "plays founded on moral tales in private life may be of admirable
use... by stifling vice in its first principles". Dramatists who were
concerned only or primarily with the first of these tendencies (the emotional
effect), produced domestic or pseudo-domestic tragedies in the manner of Otway
and Rowe. But those who stressed the second (moral and religious utility),
seeking practical themes of widespread applicability, quite logically moved
toward genuine middle-class tragedy. Thus Hill's <u>Fatal</u> <u>Extravagance</u>
is concerned with the "vice" of gambling; while Charles Johnson's <u>Caelia</u>,
<u>or</u> <u>The</u> <u>Perjur'd Lover</u> (1732) attacks fashionable
libertinism of the day, telling the story which Richardson was later to retell
in seven ponderous volumes. In <u>Caelia</u> the religious rationalization of
the tragic action is subdued, Johnson apparently preferring to stress the
social and moral aspects of his subject, and to this end he resolutely refused
to expunge or modify the boldly realistic brothel scenes, against which a
fastidious audience had protested.</tt></p>

<p><tt>A comparison of <u>The</u> <u>Gamester</u> with its predecessor,
<u>Fatal</u> <u>Extravagance</u>, reflects certain developments in the
intellectual background of the first half of the eighteenth century. Hill
anticipated Lillo in repeating Rowe's argument for lowering the social level
of tragedy and in stating vigorously his desire to defend the stage by
demonstrating its religious and moral utility. An admirer of Dennis's critical
writings, Hill repeats Dennis's argument that the stage can affect those whom
the pulpit falls to reach, and he offers his play</tt></p>

<p><tt>as proof that "sound and useful instruction may be drawn from the
<u>Theatre</u>", challenging the enemies of the stage to test his play "by the
rules of religion
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
and virtue" (Preface). Taking a "hint", as he says, from <u>A</u> <u>Yorkshire</u>
<u>Tragedy</u>, Hill endeavored to show the "private sorrows" that result from
gaming.</tt></p>

<p><tt>At the opening of the play, the hero, having gambled away his fortune,
faces poverty. His friend who signed his bond is in jail and a kindly uncle
has failed to secure the needed relief. In a fit of passion growing out of
despair, the hero kills the villainous creditor, and decides to poison his
(the hero's) wife and children, and then stab himself. In his dying moments he
learns that the uncle has substituted a harmless cordial for the poison and
that a long-lost brother has died leaving him a fortune. This bare outline
gives no indication of Hill's careful theological rationalization of character
and plot which he promised in his preface. Hill incorporated in his play the
teachings of orthodox divines; there is nothing 'revolutionary' in his
analytical presentation of human nature. The theological significance of
Hill's play has not, to my knowledge, been recognized; thematic passages tend
to be dismissed as tiresome and gratuitous moralizing and the plot is often
regarded as empty melodrama or the representation of some ambiguous 'fate'. It
is in this deliberate theological rationalization of his materials that Hill
owes most to Mrs. Trotter's domestic tragedy and that he differs significantly
from Moore.</tt></p>

<p><tt>As with Hill and Lillo, Moore's desire to write a play with an
extensively useful 'moral' led him to middle-class realism and prose. To
attack the widespread fashion of gaming which he regarded as a "vice", Moore
attempted to present "a natural picture" in language adapted "to the
capacities and feelings of every part of the audience" (Preface, 1756). That
he should have treated this social problem tragically is to be explained,
perhaps, by his sources and by his religious background. He justified the
"horror of its catastrophe" on the grounds that "so prevailing and destructive
a vice as Gaming" warranted it. <u>The</u> <u>Gamester</u> has been justly
credited with superior dramatic qualities in comparison with Hill's <u>Fatal</u>
<u>Extravagance,</u>, but we might perhaps note briefly certain aspects of the
two plays which reflect changes in the intellectual background. In both plays
theological ideas are involved in the treatment of the fall of the hero,
partially
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
in Moore's play, completely In Hill's. Not recognizing ideas common to early
eighteenth century sermons, the modern reader may perhaps puzzle over the
steadily increasing moral paralysis and despondency in Moore's hero,
<ins class = "correction" title = "spelling as in original">Beverly</ins>.
Vice, preached the divines, beclouds the reason, leaving it progressively
incapable of controlling the passions:</tt></p>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;Follies, if uncontroul'd, of every kind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow into passions, and subdue the mind. (V, 4)</tt></p>

<p><tt>Further each commission of sin causes progressive loss of grace,
without which man cannot act rightly. In prison
<ins class = "correction" title = "spelling as in original">Beverly</ins>
is incapable of prayer
("I cannot pray--Despair has laid his iron hand upon me, and seal'd me for
perdition..."). However, a benevolent deity touches him with the finger of
grace, enabling him to repent ("I wish'd for ease, a moment's ease, that cool
repentance and contrition might soften vengeance"). He can now pray for mercy
and in his dying moments is vouchsafed assurance of forgiveness ("Yet Heaven
is gracious--I ask'd for hope, as the bright presage of forgiveness, and like
a light, blazing thro' darkness, it came and chear'd me...").</tt></p>

<p><tt>In this aspect Moore is working along the lines laid down by Hill, but
there is a significant difference, attributable perhaps to the weakening of
orthodox theology and the spreading influence of the Shaftesburian school of
ethical theorists. In the older theology, man's progressive loss of grace
correspondingly releases his natural propensity for evil, and working in these
concepts neither Hill nor Lillo hesitated to show his hero descending to
murder. Moore, influenced perhaps by the ethical sentiments of the day,
compromised his theological concepts and permitted his hero no really evil act
(excluding of course his suicide), and stressed instead
<ins class = "correction" title = "spelling as in original">Beverly's</ins> mistaken
trust in Stukely, who is, as Elton has pointed out, a "Mandevillian man"
(<u>Survey</u> <u>of</u> <u>English</u> <u>Literature:</u> <u>1730-1760</u>,
I, 329-30).</tt></p>

<p><tt>There is another significant difference between the two plays which
reflects the development of religious thought in the first half of the
eighteenth century. Commenting on the too-late arrival of the news of the
uncle's death,
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
Elton remarks that "this <u>too-lateness</u>... which is in the nature of an
accident, is a common and mechanical device of Georgian tragedy" (I, 330).
Hill employed the device, the good news coming as a complete surprise, but he
made it part of a carefully ordered plot designed to reveal the direct
intervention and mysterious workings of a particular Providence, making
characterization and action consistent, and giving his play a precise
theological significance. In Moore's day, however, under the impact of deism
and the developing rationalism, the concept of a particular Providence in
orthodox theology had become so subtilized that the older idea of direct and
striking intervention in human affairs all but disappeared. By mid-eighteenth
century, deity, as Leslie Stephen points out, "appears under the colourless
shape of Providence--a word which may be taken to imply a remote divine
superintendence, without admitting an actual divine interference" (<u>History</u>
<u>of</u> <u>English</u> <u>Thought</u> <u>In</u> <u>the</u> <u>Eighteenth</u>
<u>Century</u>, II, 336). The references to Providence in Moore's play are of
this type, pious labels on prudential morality. Moore carefully avoids the
various devices employed by Hill to indicate direct divine intervention;
consequently the late arrival of the news of the uncle's death (which was
expected throughout the play) is without special meaning, and serves only as a
theatrical device intended to heighten the emotional effect. <u>The</u>
<u>Gamester</u>, then, is a clear reflection of the state of English thought
in the middle of the eighteenth century, in which a declining theology becomes
suffused with the ideas and sentiments of the moralists of the age.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Despite the popularity of their plays, neither Lillo nor Moore inspired
any significant followers in England. On the Continent, however, their
influence was considerable. In his introduction to his edition of <u>The</u>
<u>London</u> <u>Merchant</u>, A.W. Ward traces Lillo's influence on the
Continent, and Caskey gives a detailed account of Moore's (119-134).
<u>The</u> <u>Gamester</u> was translated into German, French, Dutch, Spanish,
and Italian. It was first acted at Breslau in 1754 and retained its stage
popularity for more than two decades. A German translation appeared in 1754,
and for more than twenty years numerous editions and translations
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
continued to appear. In France, Diderot admired the play and translated it in
1760 (not published until 1819); Saurin's translation and adaptation (1767)
proved popular on the French stage (he later provided an alternate happy
ending which was frequently played).</tt></p>

<p><tt>The first edition of Moore's <u>The</u> <u>Gamester</u> appeared in
1753 shortly after the opening of Garrick's performance of the play on
February 7. This edition is in many respects a good text; it has seemed
desirable for several reasons, however, to reprint this work from the 1756
edition of <u>Poems</u>, <u>Fables</u>, <u>and</u> <u>Plays</u> (often
referred to as the "Collected Works"). The 1756 text often corrects that of
1753 and is generally superior to later printings; it contains passages and
improved readings not present in other editions; it aims at formal correctness,
employing classical scene division; as a "Works" edition it exhibits excellent
editorial and typographical treatment; it enjoys a superior general readability
advantageous to classroom use; and, finally, it contains Moore's vindicatory
preface, which, as far as an examination of available copies shows, does not
appear in other editions. Inasmuch as the 1756 printing is somewhat late,
standing between the fourth and fifth editions of the play, a brief bibliographical
account of <u>The</u> <u>Gamester</u> is offered.</tt></p>

<p><tt>The play was printed separately many times in the eighteenth century.
The first edition, in the University of Michigan copy, bears the title: THE /
GAMESTER. / A / TRAGEDY. / As it is Acted at the / <u>Theatre</u>-<u>Royal</u>
in <u>Drury</u>-<u>Lane</u>. / [rule] / ornament / [rule] / <u>LONDON</u>: /
Printed for R. FRANCKLIN, in <u>Russel</u>-<u>Street</u>, / <u>Covent</u>-<u>Garden</u>;
and Sold by R. DODSLEY, / in <u>Pall</u>-<u>Mall</u>. M.DCC.LIII. / The
anonymity of the titlepage is half-hearted, for the dedication to Henry Pelham
is signed "Edw. Moore." A prologue written by Garrick, an epilogue, and the
cast of the original performance precede the eighty-four page text. Francklin
and Dodsley brought out a second edition in the same year and a fourth edition
in 1755; presumably a third edition had been issued in the interim. In 1771 a
fifth and a sixth edition appeared, and in 1776 another London edition came
out. In 1784 two more editions made an appearance, the first printed for R.
Butters (John H. Caskey, <u>The</u> <u>Life</u> <u>and</u> <u>Works</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Edward</u> <u>Moore</u>, Yale Studies in English, LXXV [New
Haven, 1927], p. 174), the second
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
printed for a group of four booksellers--Thomas Davies, W. Nicoll, Samuel
Bladon, and John Bew. The same combination of booksellers, with W. Lowndes
taking the place of Davies, issued in 1789 an inferior reprinting of their
1784 text. The editions of 1784 and 1789 are interesting because they identify
by inverted commas the cuts made in contemporary stage versions. Before the
end of the century three editions were printed outside London: two Dublin
imprints of 1763 and 1783, and an American imprint of 1791 by Henry Taylor in
Philadelphia.</tt></p>

<p><tt>In addition to these separate publications, <u>The</u> <u>Gamester</u>
was included in two collections of Moore's works. The 1756 edition has already
been noticed. THE DRAMATIC WORKS OF Mr. Edward Moore, as the 1788 titlepage
describes the volume, was issued by the Lowndes-Nicoll-Bladon-Bew group and
was actually an assembled text made up of the 1784 printing of <u>The</u>
<u>Gamester</u>, the 1786 <u>The</u> <u>Foundling</u>, and the 1788 <u>Gil</u>
<u>Blas</u>.</tt></p>

<p><tt>The play was a favorite in many popular dramatic collections of the
late eighteenth and early nineteenth century; it appeared in Bell's <u>British</u>
<u>Theatre</u> in 1776 and thereafter, in Mrs. Inchbald's <u>The</u>
<u>British</u> <u>Theatre</u> in 1808, in Dibdin's <u>London</u> <u>Theatre</u>
in 1815, and in Cumberland's <u>British</u> <u>Theatre</u> in 1826. According
to Caskey and other sources the play was thus reprinted more than a dozen
times by the middle of the nineteenth century. Since then it has declined in
favor and has seldom been reprinted, even in textbook anthologies covering
representative literature of the period.</tt></p>

<p><tt>The 1756 text of the play and the plates from the Davies-Nicoll-Bladon-Bew
1784 edition have been reproduced through the cooperation of the University of
Michigan Library from copies of these editions in its possession. Because of
its lack of significance, the dedication to Henry Pelham has not been
reprinted.</tt></p>

<p><i>It having been objected to this tragedy, that its language is prose, and
its catastrophe too horrible, I shall entreat the reader's patience for a
minute, that I may say a word or two to these objections.</i></p>

<p><i>The play of the <span class = "smallcaps">Gamester</span> was intended
to be a natural picture of that kind of life, of which all men are judges; and
as it struck at a vice so universally prevailing, it was thought proper to
adapt its language to the capacities and feelings of every part of the
audience: that as some of its characters were of no higher rank than
</i>Sharpers<i>, it was imagined that (whatever good company they may find
admittance to in the world) their speaking blank verse upon the stage would be
unnatural, if not ridiculous. But though the more elevated characters also
speak prose, the judicious reader will observe, that it is a species of prose
which differs very little from verse: in many of the most animated scenes, I
can truly say, that I often found it a much greater difficulty to avoid,
<span class = "pagenum">418</span>
than to write, </i>measure<i>. I shall only add, in answer to this objection,
that I hoped to be more interesting, by being more natural; and the event, as
far as I have been a witness of it, has more than answered my expectations.</i></p>

<p><i>As to the other objection, the horror of its catastrophe, if it be
considered simply what that catastrophe is, and compared with those of other
tragedies, I should humbly presume that the working it up to any uncommon
degree of horror, is the </i>merit<i> of the play, and not its </i>reproach<i>.
Nor should so prevailing and destructive a vice as <span class = "smallcaps">Gaming</span>
be attacked upon the theatre, without impressing upon the imagination all the
horrors that may attend it.</i></p>

<p><i>I shall detain the reader no longer than to inform him, that I am
indebted for many of the most popular passages in this play to the inimitable
performer, who, in the character of the</i> Gamester, <i>exceeded every idea I
had conceived of it in the writing.</i></p>

<div class = "verse">
<i>Like fam'd La Mancha's knight, who launce in hand,<br>
Mounted his steed to free th' enchanted land,<br>
Our Quixote bard sets forth a monster-taming,<br>
Arm'd at all points, to fight that hydra&mdash;<span class = "smallcaps">Gaming</span>.<br>
Aloft on Pegasus he waves his pen,<br>
And hurls defiance at the caitiff's den.<br>
The </i>First<i> on fancy'd giants spent his rage,<br>
But </i>This<i> has more than windmills to engage:<br>
He combats passion, rooted in the soul,<br>
Whose pow'rs, at once delight ye, and controul;<br>
Whose magic bondage each lost slave enjoys,<br>
Nor wishes freedom, though the spell destroys.<br>
To save our land from this <span class = "smallcaps">Magician</span>'s charms,<br>
And rescue maids and matrons from his arms,<br>
Our knight poetic comes. And Oh! ye fair!<br>
This black <span class = "smallcaps">Enchanter</span>'s wicked arts beware!<br>
His subtle poison dims the brightest eyes,<br>
And at his touch, each grace and beauty dies:<br>
Love, gentleness and joy to rage give way,<br>
And the soft dove becomes a bird of prey.<br>
May this our bold advent'rer break the spell,<br>
And drive the </i>demon<i> to his native hell.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye slaves of passion, and ye dupes of chance,<br>
Wake all your pow'rs from this destructive trance!<br>
Shake off the shackles of this tyrant vice:<br>
Hear other calls than those of cards and dice:<br>
Be learn'd in nobler arts, than arts of </i>play<i>,<br>
And other debts, than those of </i>honour<i> pay:<br>
No longer live insensible to shame,<br>
Lost to your country, families and fame.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could our romantic muse this work atchieve,<br>
Would there one honest heart in </i>Britain<i> grieve?<br>
Th' attempt, though wild, would not in vain be made,<br>
If every honest hand would lend its aid.</i>

and <span class = "charname">Charlotte</span>.</div>

<div class = "firstspkr">Mrs. BEVERLEY.</div>
<p><span class = "firstletter">B</span>E comforted, my dear; all may be well
yet. And now, methinks, the lodgings begin to look with another face. O
sister! sister! if these were all my hardships; if all I had to complain of
were no more than quitting my house, servants, equipage and show, your pity
would be weakness.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Is poverty nothing then?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Nothing in the world, if it affected only Me. While we had
a fortune, I was the happiest of the rich: and now 'tis gone, give me but a
bare subsistance, and my
<span class = "pagenum">422</span>
husband's smiles, and I'll be the happiest of the poor. To Me now these
lodgings want nothing but their master. Why d'you look so at me?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> That I may hate my brother.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Don't talk so, Charlotte.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Has he not undone you? Oh! this pernicious vice of gaming! But
methinks his usual hours of four or five in the morning might have contented
him; 'twas misery enough to wake for him till then: need he have staid out all
night? I shall learn to detest him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Not for the first fault. He never slept from me before.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Slept from you! No, no; his nights have nothing to do with
sleep. How has this one vice driven him from every virtue! nay, from his
affections too!&mdash;The time <i>was</i>, sister&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> And <i>is</i>. I have no fear of his affections. Would I
knew that he were safe!</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> From ruin and his companions. But that's impossible. His poor
little boy too! What must become of Him?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Why, want shall teach him industry. From his father's
mistakes he shall learn prudence, and from his mother's resignation, patience.
Poverty has no such terrors in it as you imagine. There's no condition of
life, sickness and pain excepted, where happiness is excluded. The needy
peasant, who rises early to his labour, enjoys more welcome rest at night
for't. His bread is sweeter to him; his home happier; his family dearer; his
enjoyments surer. The sun that rouses him in the morning, sets in the evening
to release him. All situations have their comforts, if sweet contentment dwell
in the heart. But my poor Beverley has none. The thought of having ruined
those he loves, is misery for ever to him. Would I could ease his mind of
That!</p>


<span class = "pagenum">423</span>
<p><i>Char.</i> If He alone were ruined, 'twere just he should be punished. He
is my brother, 'tis true; but when I think of what he has done; of the fortune
You brought him; of his own large estate too, squandered away upon this vilest
of passions, and among the vilest of wretches! O! I have no patience! My own
little fortune is untouched, he says: would I were sure on't!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> And so you may; 'twould be a sin to doubt it.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I will be sure on't. 'Twas madness in me to give it to his
management. But I'll demand it from him this morning. I have a melancholy
occasion for't.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> What occasion?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> To support a sister.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> No; I have no need on't. Take it, and reward a lover with
it. The generous Lewson deserves much more. Why won't you make him happy?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Because my sister's miserable.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> You must not think so. I have my jewels left yet. I'll
sell them to supply our wants; and when all's gone these hands shall toil for
our support. The poor should be industrious&mdash;Why those tears, Charlotte?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> They flow in pity for you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> All may be well yet. When he has nothing to lose, I shall
fetter him in these arms again; and then what is it to be poor?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Cure him but of this destructive passion, and my uncle's death
may retrieve all yet.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Ay, Charlotte, <i>could</i> we cure him. But the disease
of play admits no cure but poverty; and the loss of another fortune would but
encrease his shame and his affliction. Will Mr. Lewson call this morning?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">424</span>
<p><i>Char.</i> He said so last night. He gave me hints too, that he had
suspicions of our friend Stukely.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Not of treachery to your Brother? That he loves play I
know; but surely he is honest.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> He would fain be thought so; therefore I doubt him. Honesty
needs no pains to set itself off.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> What now, Lucy?</p>


<div class = "scene">SCENE II.</div>

<div class = "scenedesc">Enter <span class = "charname">Lucy</span>.</div>

<i>Lucy</i>. Your old steward, madam. I had not the heart to deny him

<div class = "scene">SCENE III.</div>

<div class = "scenedesc">Enter <span class = "charname">Jarvis</span>.</div>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Is this well, Jarvis? I desired you to avoid me.</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> Did you, madam? I am an old man, and had forgot. Perhaps too
you forbad my tears; but I am old, madam, and age will be forgetful.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> The faithful creature! how he moves me!</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>To Charlotte.</i></div>

<p><i>Char.</i> Not to have seen him had been cruelty.</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> I have forgot these apartments too. I remember none such in my
young master's house; and yet I have lived in't these five and twenty years.
His good father would not have dismissed me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> He had no reason, Jarvis.</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> I was faithful to him while he lived, and when he
<span class = "pagenum">425</span><span class = "folionum">Iii</span>
died, he bequeathed me to his son. I have been faithful to Him too.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> I know it, I know it, Jarvis.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> We both know it.</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> I am an old man, madam, and have not a long time to live. I
asked but to have died with him, and he dismissed me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Prithee no more of this! 'Twas his poverty that dismissed
you.</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> Is he indeed so poor then? Oh! he was the joy of my old heart.
But must his creditors have all? And have they sold his house too? His father
built it when He was but a prating boy. The times I have carried him in these
arms! And, Jarvis, says he, when a beggar has asked charity of me, why should
people be poor? You shan't be poor, Jarvis; if I was a king, nobody should be
poor. Yet He is poor. And then he was so brave!&mdash;O, he was a brave little
boy! And yet so merciful, he'd not have killed the gnat that stung him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Speak to him, Charlotte; for I cannot.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> When I have wiped my eyes.</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> I have a little money, madam; it might have been more, but I
have loved the poor. All that I have is yours.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> No, Jarvis; we have enough yet. I thank you though, and
will deserve your goodness.</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> But shall I see my master? And will he let me attend him in his
distresses? I'll be no expence to him: and 'twill kill me to be refused. Where
is he, madam?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Not at home, Jarvis. You shall see him another time.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> To-morrow, or the next day. O, Jarvis! what a change is
here!</p>
<span class = "pagenum">426</span>


<p><i>Jar.</i> A change indeed, madam! My old heart akes at it. And yet
methinks&mdash;But here's somebody coming.</p>


<div class = "scene">SCENE IV.</div>

<div class = "scenedesc">Enter <span class = "charname">Lucy</span> with <span
class = "charname">Stukely</span>.</div>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Mr. Stukely, Madam.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>Exit.</i></div>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Good morning to you, Ladies. Mr. Jarvis, your servant. Where's
my friend, madam?</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>To Mrs. Beverley.</i></div>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> I should have asked that question of You. Have not you
seen him to-day?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> No, madam.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Nor last night?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Last night! Did not he come home then?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> No. Were not you together?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> At the beginning of the evening; but not since. Where can he
have staid?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> You call yourself his friend, Sir; why do you encourage him in
this madness of gaming?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> You have asked me that question before, madam; and I told you
my concern was that I could not save him. Mr. Beverley is a man, madam; and if
the most friendly entreaties have no effect upon him, I have no other means.
My purse has been his, even to the injury of my fortune. If That has been
encouragement, I deserve censure; but I meant it to retrieve him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> I don't doubt it, Sir; and I thank you. But where did you
leave him last night?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> At Wilson's, madam, if I ought to tell; in company I did not
like. Possibly he may be there still. Mr. Jarvis knows the house, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> Shall I go, madam?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">427</span><span class = "folionum">Iii2</span>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> No; he may take it ill.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> He may go as from himself.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> And if he pleases, madam, without naming Me. I am faulty
myself, and should conceal the errors of a friend. But I can refuse nothing
here.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>Bowing to the ladies.</i></div>

<p><i>Jar.</i> I would fain see him, methinks.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Do so then. But take care how you upbraid him. I have
never upbraided him.</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> Would I could bring him comfort!</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>Exit.</i></div>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Don't be too much alarmed, madam. All men have their errors,
and their times of seeing them. Perhaps my friend's time is not come yet. But
he has an uncle; and old men don't live for ever. You should look forward,
madam: we are taught how to value a second fortune by the loss of a first.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>A knocking at the door.</i></div>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Hark!&mdash;No; that knocking was too rude for Mr.
Beverley. Pray heaven he be well!</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Never doubt it, madam. You shall be well too: every thing shall
be well.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>Knocking again.</i></div>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> The knocking is a little loud though. Who waits there?
Will none of you answer?&mdash;None of you, did I say? Alas! I thought myself
in my own house, surrounded with servants.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I'll go, sister&mdash;But don't be alarmed so.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>Exit.</i></div>

<p><i>Stu.</i> What extraordinary accident have you to fear, madam?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> I beg your pardon; but 'tis ever thus with me in Mr.
Beverley's absence. No one knocks at the door, but I fancy 'tis a messenger of
ill news.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> You are too fearful, madam; 'twas but one night of absence; and
if ill thoughts intrude (as love is always
<span class = "pagenum">428</span>
doubtful) think of your worth and beauty, and drive them from your breast.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> What thoughts? I have no thoughts that wrong my husband.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Such thoughts indeed would wrong him. The world is full of
slander; and every wretch that knows himself unjust, charges his neighbour
with like passions; and by the general frailty, hides his own. If you are
wise, and would be happy, turn a deaf ear to such reports: 'tis ruin to
believe them.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Ay, worse than ruin. 'Twould be to sin against conviction.
Why was it mentioned?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> To guard you against rumour. The sport of half mankind is
mischief; and for a single error they make men devils. If their tales reach
you, disbelieve them.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> What tales? By whom? Why told? I have heard nothing; or if
I had, with all his errors, my Beverley's firm faith admits no doubt. It is my
safety; my seat of rest and joy, while the storm threatens round me. I'll not
forsake it. (<i>Stukely sighs, and looks down</i>) Why turn you from me? And
why that sigh?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> I was attentive, madam; and sighs will come we know not why.
Perhaps I have been too busy. If it should seem so, impute my zeal to
friendship, that meant to guard you against evil tongues. Your Beverley is
wronged; slandered most vilely. My life upon his truth.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> And mine too. Who is't that doubts it? But no matter&mdash;I
am prepared, Sir.&mdash;Yet why this caution?&mdash;You are my husband's
friend; I think you mine too; the common friend of both. (<i>Pauses</i>) I had
been unconcerned else.</p>
<span class = "pagenum">429</span>

<p><i>Stu.</i> For heaven's sake, madam, be so still! I meant to guard you
<i>against</i> suspicion, not to alarm it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Nor have you, Sir. Who told you of suspicion? I have a
heart it cannot reach.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Then I am happy&mdash;I would say more, but am prevented.</p>


<div class = "scene">SCENE V.</div>

<div class = "scenedesc">Re-enter <span class = "charname">Charlotte</span>.</div>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Who was it, Charlotte?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> What a heart has that Jarvis!&mdash;A creditor, sister. But
the good old man has taken him away. Don't distress his wife! Don't distress
his sister! I could hear him say. 'Tis cruel to distress the afflicted. And
when he saw me at the door, he begged pardon that his friend had knocked so
loud.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> I wish I had known of this. Was it a large demand, madam?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I heard not that; but visits such as these, we must expect
often. Why so distressed, sister? This is no new affliction.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> No, Charlotte; but I am faint with watching;</p>

quite sunk and spiritless. Will you excuse me, Sir? I'll to my chamber, and
try to rest a little.

<p><i>Stu.</i> Good thoughts go with you, madam.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>Exit Mrs. Beverley.</i></div>
My bait is taken then. (<i>Aside.</i>) Poor Mrs. Beverley! How my heart
grieves to see her thus!

<p><i>Char.</i> Cure her, and be a friend then.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> How cure her, madam?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Reclaim my brother.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">430</span>
<p><i>Stu.</i> Ay; give him a new creation; or breathe another soul into him.
I'll think on't, madam. Advice, I see, is thankless.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Useless I am sure it is, if through mistaken friendship, or
other motives, you feed his passion with your purse, and sooth it by example.
Physicians, to cure fevers, keep from the patient's thirsty lip the cup that
would inflame him; You give it to his hands. (<i>A knocking.</i>) Hark, Sir!
These are my brother's desperate symptoms. Another creditor.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> One not so easily got rid of&mdash;What, Lewson!</p>


<div class = "scene">SCENE VI.</div>

<div class = "scenedesc">Enter <span class = "charname">Lewson</span>.</div>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Madam, your servant. Yours, Sir. I was enquiring for you at
your lodgings.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> This morning? You had business then?</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> You'll call it by another name, perhaps. Where's Mr. Beverley,
madam?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> We have sent to enquire for him.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Is he abroad then? He did not use to go out so early.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> No; nor to stay out so late.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Is that the case? I am sorry for it. But Mr. Stukely, perhaps,
may direct you to him.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> I have already, Sir. But what was your business with Me?</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> To congratulate you upon your late successes at play. Poor
Beverley! But You are his friend; and there's a comfort in having successful
friends.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> And what am I to understand by this?</p>
<span class = "pagenum">431</span>

<p><i>Lew.</i> That Beverley's a poor man, with a rich friend; that's
all.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Your words would mean something, I suppose. Another time, Sir,
I shall desire an explanation.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> And why not now? I am no dealer in long sentences. A minute or
two will do for me.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> But not for Me, Sir. I am slow of apprehension, and must have
time and privacy. A lady's presence engages my attention. Another morning I
may be found at home.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Another morning then, I'll wait upon you.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> I shall expect you, Sir. Madam, your servant.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>Exit.</i></div>

<p><i>Char.</i> What mean you by this?</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> To hint to him that I know him.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> How know him? Mere doubt and supposition!</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> I shall have proof soon.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> And what then? Would you risk your life to be his punisher?</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> My life, madam! Don't be afraid. And yet I am happy in your
concern for me. But let it content you that I know this Stukely. 'Twould be as
easy to make him honest as brave.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> And what d'you intend to do?</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Nothing, till I have proof. Yet my suspicions are well-grounded.
But methinks, madam, I am acting here without authority. Could I have leave to
call Mr. Beverley brother, his concerns would be my own. Why will you make my
services appear officious?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> You know my reasons, and should not press me. But I am cold,
you say: and cold I will be, while a poor sister's destitute. My heart bleeds
for her! and till I see her sorrows moderated, love has no joys for me.
<span class = "pagenum">432</span>
<i>Lew.</i> Can I be less a friend by being a brother? I would not say an
unkind thing; but the pillar of your house is shaken. Prop it with another,
and it shall stand firm again. You must comply.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> And will, when I have peace within myself. But let us change
the subject. Your business here this morning is with my sister. Misfortunes

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Good morning, Sir. I heard your voice, and, as I thought,
enquiring for me. Where's Mr. Stukely, Charlotte?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> This moment gone. You have been in tears, sister; but here's a
friend shall comfort you.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Or if I add to your distresses, I'll beg your pardon, madam.
The sale of your house and furniture was finished yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> I know it, Sir. I know too your generous reason for
putting me in mind of it. But you have obliged me too much already.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> There are trifles, madam, which you have set a value on: those
I have purchased, and will deliver. I have a friend too that esteems you; he
has bought largely, and will call nothing his, till he has seen you. If a
visit to him would not be painful, he has begged it may be this morning.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">433</span><span class = "folionum">Kkk</span>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Not painful in the least. My pain is from the kindness of
my friends. Why am I to be obliged beyond the power of return?</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> You shall repay us at your own time. I have a coach waiting at
the door. Shall we have Your company, madam?</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>To Charlotte.</i></div>

<p><i>Char.</i> No. My brother may return soon; I'll stay and receive
him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> He may want a comforter, perhaps. But don't upbraid him,
Charlotte. We shan't be absent long. Come, Sir, since I <i>must</i> be so
obliged.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> 'Tis I that am obliged. An hour or less will be sufficient for
us. We shall find you at home, madam? (<i>To Charlotte.</i>)</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>Exit with Mrs. Beverley.</i></div>

<p><i>Stu.</i> That Lewson suspects me, 'tis too plain. Yet why should he
suspect me? I appear the friend of Beverley as well as he. But I am rich it
seems: and so I am; thanks to another's folly and my own wisdom. To what use
is wisdom, but to take advantage of the weak? This Beverley's my fool: I cheat
him, and he calls me friend. But more business must be done yet. His wife's
jewels are unsold; so is the reversion of his uncle's estate. I must have
these too. And then there's a treasure above all. I love his wife. Before she
knew this Beverley, I loved her; but like
<span class = "pagenum">434</span>
a cringing fool, bowed at a distance, while He stept in and won her. Never,
never will I forgive him for it. My pride, as well as love, is wounded by this
conquest. I must have vengeance. Those hints, this morning, were well thrown
in. Already they have fastened on her. If jealousy should weaken her
affections, want may corrupt her virtue. My hate rejoyces in the hope. These
jewels may do much. He shall demand them of her; which, when mine, shall be
converted to special purposes.&mdash;What now, Bates?</p>


<div class = "scene">SCENE IX.</div>

<div class = "scenedesc">Enter <span class = "charname">Bates</span>.</div>

<p><i>Bates.</i> Is it a wonder then to see me? The forces are in readiness,
and only wait for orders. Where's Beverley?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> At last night's rendezvous, waiting for Me. Is Dawson with
you?</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> Dressed like a nobleman; with money in his pocket, and a set
of dice that shall deceive the devil.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> That fellow has a head to undo a nation. But for the rest, they
are such low-mannered, ill-looking dogs, I wonder Beverley has not suspected
them.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> No matter for manners and looks: do You supply them with
money, and they are gentlemen by profession. The passion of gaming casts such
a mist before the eyes, that the nobleman shall be surrounded with sharpers,
and imagine himself in the best company.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> There's that Williams too: it was He, I suppose, that called at
Beverley's with the note this morning. What directions did you give him?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">435</span><span class = "folionum">Kkk2</span>

<p><i>Bates.</i> To knock loud, and be clamorous. Did not you see him?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> No. The fool sneaked off with Jarvis. Had he appeared
within-doors, as directed, the note had been discharged. I waited there on
purpose. I want the women to think well of me; for Lewson's grown suspicious;
he told me so himself.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> What answer did you make him?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> A short one. That I would see him soon, for farther explanation.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> We must take care of him. But what have we to do with
Beverley? Dawson and the rest are wondering at you.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Why let them wonder. I have designs above Their narrow reach.
They see me lend him money; and they stare at me. But they are fools. I want
him to believe me beggared by him.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> And what then?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Ay, there's the question; but no matter. At night you may know
more. He waits for me at Wilson's. I told the women where to find him.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> To what purpose?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> To save suspicion. It looked friendly; and they thanked me. Old
Jarvis was dispatched to him.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> And may intreat him home.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> No; he experts money from me: but I'll have none. His wife's
jewels must go. Women are easy creatures, and refuse nothing where they love.
Follow me to Wilson's; but besure he sees you not. You are a man of character,
you know; of prudence and discretion. Wait for me

would not offend you, Sir&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> No. Think'st thou I'd ruin Thee too? I have enough of shame
already. My wife! my wife! Would'st thou believe it, Jarvis? I have not seen
her all this long night; I, who have loved her so, that every hour of abscence
seemed as a gap in life. But other bonds have held me. O! I have played the

follow misery? Or if thou wilt, go to thy mistress&mdash;She has no guilt to
sting her, and therefore may be comforted.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Nor I to bear it. How speaks the world of me, Jarvis?</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> As of a good man dead. Of one, who walking in a dream, fell
down a precipice. The world is sorry for you.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Ay, and pities me. Says it not so? But I was born to infamy.
I'll tell thee what it says. It calls me villain; a treacherous husband; a
cruel father; a false brother; one lost to nature and her charities&mdash;Or
to say all in one short word, it calls me&mdash;Gamester. Go to thy mistress;
I'll see her presently.</p>

to-morrow. But others may be pressing; and she has grief enough already. Your

at least, we'll try for't.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> No, it has fooled us on too far.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Ay, ruined us; and therefore we'll sit down contented. These
are the despondings of men without money; but let the shining ore chink in the
pocket, and folly turns to wisdom. We are fortune's children. True, she's a

<span class = "pagenum">441</span><span class = "folionum">Lll</span>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Is this a time for levity? But You are single in the ruin, and

<p><i>Stu.</i> I would have brought you money; but lenders want securities.
What's to be done? All that was mine is yours already.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> And there's the weight that sinks me. I have undone my friend
too; one, who to save a drowning wretch, reached out his hand, and perished
with him.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Have better thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Whence are they to proceed? I have nothing left.</p>

<i>Stu. (Sighing) </i>Then we're indeed undone. What, nothing? No moveables?
nor useless trinkets? Bawbles, locked up in caskets, to starve their owners? I
have ventured deeply for you.

<p><i>Bev.</i> Therefore this heart-ake; for I am lost beyond all hope.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> No : means may be found to save us. Jarvis is rich. Who made
him so? This is no time for ceremony.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> And is it for dishonesty? The good old man! Shall I rob Him
too? My friend would grieve for't. No; let the little that he has, buy food

<p><i>Stu.</i> And will they feed us? You deal unkindly by me. I have sold and
borrowed for you, while land or credit lasted; and now, when fortune should be
tried, and my heart whispers me success, I am deserted; turned loose to
beggary, while You have hoards.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> What hoards? Name them, and take them.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Jewels.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> And shall this thriftless hand seize Them too? My poor, poor
wife! Must she lose all? I would not wound her so.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Nor I, but from necessity. One effort more, and fortune may
grow kind. I have unusual hopes.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Think of some other means then.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> I have; and you rejected them.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Prithee let me be a man.</p>

trinkets of a woman, why, let her keep them to deck out pride with, and shew a
laughing world that she has finery to starve in.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> No; she shall yield up all. My friend demands it. But need he
have talked lightly of her? The jewels that She values are truth and
innocence: those will adorn her ever; and for the rest, she wore them for a
husband's pride, and to his wants will give them. Alas! you know her not.
Where shall we meet?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> No matter. I have changed my mind. Leave me to a prison; 'tis
the reward of friendship.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Perish mankind first! Leave you to a prison! No: fallen as you
see me, I'm not that wretch. Nor would I change this heart, overcharged as
'tis with folly and misfortune,
<span class = "pagenum">443</span><span class = "folionum">Lll2</span>

<p><i>Bev.</i> In such a cause, not to be warm is to be frozen. Farewell. I'll
meet you at your lodgings.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Reflect a little. The jewels may be lost. Better not hazard
them. I was too pressing.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Ay, worse than ruined; stabbed in his fame; mortally stabbed.
Riches can't cure him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> I never doubted him.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> No; You are charity. Meekness and ever-during patience live in
that heart, and love that knows no change&mdash;Why did I ruin you?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">448</span>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> You have not ruined me. I have no wants when You are

resigned to what has happened, and I am rich beyond the dreams of avarice.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> My generous girl!&mdash;But memory will be busy; still crowding
on my thoughts, to sour the present by the past. I have another pang
too.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Tell it, and let me cure it.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> That friend, that generous friend, whose fame they have
traduced&mdash;I have undone Him too. While he had means, he lent me largely;
and now a prison must be his portion.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> No; I hope otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> To hope must be to act. The charitable wish feeds not the
hungry. Something must be done.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> In bitterness of heart he told me, just now he told me, I had
undone him. Could I hear that, and think of happiness? No; I have disclaimed
it, while He is miserable.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> The world may mend with us, and then we may be grateful.
There's comfort in that hope.</p>

natural prey of knaves; nature designed them so, when she made lambs for
wolves. The laws that fear and policy have framed, nature disclaims: she knows
but two; and those are force and cunning. The nobler law is force; but then
there's danger in't; while cunning, like a skilful miner, works safely and
unseen.</p>

<p><i>Bat.</i> And therefore wisely. Force must have nerves and sinews;
cunning wants neither. The dwarf that has it, shall trip the giant's heels
up.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> And bind him to the ground. Why, we'll erect a shrine for
nature, and be her oracles. Conscience is weakness; fear made, and fear
maintains it. The dread of shame, inward reproaches, and fictitious burnings,
swell out the phantom. Nature knows none of this; Her laws are freedom.</p>

<p><i>Bat.</i> Sound doctrine, and well delivered!</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> We are sincere too, and practice what we teach. Let the grave
pedant say as much&mdash;But now to business. The jewels are disposed of; and
Beverley again worth money. He waits to count his gold out, and then comes
hither. If my design succeeds, this night we finish with

<p><i>Bat.</i> Better stop here. The sale of this reversion may be talked of;
there's danger in't.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> No; 'tis the mark I aim at. We'll thrive, and laugh. You are
the purchaser, and there's the payment. (<i>Giving a pocket book.</i>) He

'twill look like honesty.</p>

<p><i>Bat.</i> How if he suspects us?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Leave it to Me. I study hearts, and when to work upon them. Go

age, of gaming and extravagance, you have a face for't.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> No: these shall guard you from them. (<i>Offering

us.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> And shall I leave you destitute? No: Your wants are greatest.
Another climate may treat me kinder. The shelter of to-night takes me from
this.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Let these be your support then. Yet is there need of parting? I
may have means again; we'll share them, and live wisely.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> No. I should tempt you on. Habit is nature in me; ruin can't
cure it. Even now I would be gaming. Taught by experience as I am, and knowing
this poor sum is all that's left us, I am for venturing still. And say I am to
blame; yet will this little supply our wants? No; we must put it out to usury.
Whether 'tis madness in me, or some resistless impulse of good fortune, I yet
am ignorant; but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Take it, and succeed then. I'll try no more.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> 'Tis surely impulse; it pleads so strongly&mdash;But You are

<p><i>Stu.</i> Perhaps, 'twere best forgotten. But I am open in my nature, and
zealous for the honour of my friend&mdash;Lewson speaks freely of you.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Of You I know he does.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> I can forgive him for't; but for my friend I'm angry.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> What says he of me?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> That Charlotte's fortune is embezzled. He talks on't loudly.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">454</span>
<p><i>Bev.</i> He shall be silenced then&mdash;How heard you of it?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> From many. He questioned Bates about it. You must account with
him, he says.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Or He with Me&mdash;and soon too.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Speak mildly to him. Cautions are best.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I'll think on't&mdash;But whither go you?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> From poverty and prisons&mdash;No matter whither. If fortune
changes you may hear from me.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> May these be prosperous then. (<i>Offering the notes, which he
refuses</i>) Nay, they are yours; I have sworn it, and will have nothing. Take
them and use them.</p>

fortune, and ruined family. All separate interests I disclaim. Together we
have fallen; together we must rise. My heart, my honour, both will have it
so.</p>

plainness as I ask it, I shall entreat an answer. Have you repented of this
promise?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Stay, Sir. The man that can <i>suspect</i> me, shall
<i>find</i> me changed. Why am I doubted?</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> My doubts are of myself. I have my faults, and You have
observation. If from my temper, my words or actions, you have conceived a
thought against me, or even a wish for separation, all that has passed is
nothing.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> You startle me&mdash;But tell me&mdash;I must be answered
first. Is it from honour you speak this? or do you wish me changed?</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Heaven knows I do not. Life and my Charlotte are so connected,
that to lose one, were loss of both. Yet for a promise, though given in love,
and meant for binding; if time, or accident, or reason should change opinion,
with Me that promise has no force.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Why, now I'll answer you. Your doubts are prophecies&mdash;I
am really changed.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I could torment You now, as You have Me; but 'tis not in my
nature. That I am changed I own; for what at first was inclination, is now
grown reason in me; and from that reason, had I the world&mdash;nay, were I
poorer than the poorest, and You too wanting bread; with but a hovel to invite
me to&mdash;I would be yours, and happy.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> My kindest Charlotte! (<i>Seizing her hand</i>) Thanks are too
poor for this, and words too weak! But if we love so, why should our union be
delayed?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">459</span><span class = "folionum">Nnn2</span>

<p><i>Char.</i> For happier times. The present are too wretched.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> I may have reasons, that press it now.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> The strongest reasons; unanswerable ones.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Be quick and name them.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> No, madam; I am bound in honour to make conditions first; I am
bound by inclination too. This sweet profusion of kind words pains while it
pleases. I dread the losing you.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Astonishment! What mean you?</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> First promise, that to-morrow, or the next day, you will be
mine for ever.</p>

from my soul. If you'd oblige me more, give me a little time.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Why time? It robs us of our happiness.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I have a task to learn first. The little pride this fortune
gave me, must be subdued. Once we were equal;
<span class = "pagenum">460</span>
and might have met obliging and obliged. But now 'tis otherwise; and for a
life of obligations, I have not learnt to bear it.</p>

undone you, and am a villain.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> No; I think not. The villains are within.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> What villains?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Dawson and the rest&mdash;We have been dupes to sharpers.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> How know you this? I have had doubts, as well as You; yet still
as fortune changed, I blushed at my own thoughts. But You have proofs,
perhaps?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Ay, damned ones. Repeated losses: night after night, and no
reverse. Chance has no hand in this.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> I think more charitably; yet I am peevish in my nature, and apt
to doubt. The world speaks fairly of this Dawson; so does it of the rest. We
have watched them closely too. But 'tis a right usurped by losers, to think
the winners knaves. We'll have more manhood in us.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I know not what to think. This night has stung me to the
quick&mdash;blasted my reputation too. I have bound my honour to these vipers;
played meanly upon credit, till I tired them; and now they shun me, to rifle
one another. What's to be done?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Nothing. My counsels have been fatal.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> By heaven! I'll not survive this shame&mdash;Traitor!
'tis
<span class = "pagenum">462</span>
You have brought it on me. (<i>Taking hold of him.</i>) Shew me the means to
save me, or I'll commit a murder here, and next upon myself.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Why, do it then, and rid me of ingratitude.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Prithee, forgive this language&mdash;I speak I know not what.
Rage and despair are in my heart, and hurry me to madness. My home is horror
to me&mdash;I'll not return to't. Speak quickly; tell me, if in this wreck of
fortune, one hope remains? Name it, and be my oracle.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> To vent your curses on&mdash;You have bestowed them liberally.
Take your own counsel: and should a desperate hope present itself, 'twill suit
your desperate fortune. I'll not advise you.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> What hope? By heaven! I'll catch at it, however desperate. I am
so sunk in misery, it cannot lay me lower.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> You have an uncle.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Ay. What of Him?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Old men live long by temperance; while their heirs starve on
expectation.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> What mean you?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> That the reversion's yours; and will bring money to pay debts
with&mdash;nay, more; it may retrieve what's past.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Or leave my child a beggar.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> And what's his father? A dishonourable one; engaged for sums,
he cannot pay. That should be thought of.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> It is my shame; the poison that inflames me. Where shall we go?
To whom? I am impatient till all's lost.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> All may be yours again. Your man is Bates. He has large funds
at his command, and will deal justly by you.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">463</span>
<p><i>Bev.</i> I am resolved&mdash;Tell them, within, we'll meet them
presently; and with full purses too&mdash;Come, follow me.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> No. I'll have no hand in this; nor do I counsel it. Use your
discretion, and act from that. You'll find me at my lodgings.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Succeed what will, this night I'll dare the worst&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis loss of fear, to be compleatly curs'd.</i>
</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>Exit.</i></div>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Why, lose it then for ever. Fear is the mind's worst evil; and
'tis a friendly office to drive it from the bosom. Thus far has fortune
crowned me&mdash;Yet Beverley is rich; rich in his wife's best treasure; her
honour and affections. I would supplant him there too. But 'tis the curse of
thinking minds, to raise up difficulties. Fools only conquer women: fearless
of dangers which they see not, they press on boldly, and by persisting,
prosper. Yet may a tale of art do much. Charlotte is sometimes absent. The
seeds of jealousy are sown already: If I mistake not, they have taken root
too. Now is the time to ripen them, and reap the harvest. The softest of her
sex, if wronged in love, or thinking that she's wronged, becomes a tygress in
revenge. I'll instantly to Beverley's&mdash;No matter for the danger&mdash;When
beauty leads us on, 'tis indiscretion to reflect, and cowardice to doubt.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> To meet you thus alone, madam, was what I wished. Unseasonable
visits, when friendship warrants them, need no excuse; therefore I make
none.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> What mean you, Sir? And where's your friend?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Men may have secrets, madam, which their best friends are not
admitted to. We parted in the morning, not soon to meet again.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> You mean to leave us then? To leave your country too? I am
no stranger to your reasons, and pity your misfortunes.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Your pity has undone you. Could Beverley do this? That letter
was a false one; a mean contrivance, to rob you of your jewels. I wrote it
not.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Impossible! Whence came it then?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Wronged as I am, madam, I must speak plainly&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Do so, and ease me. Your hints have troubled me. Reports,
you say, are stirring&mdash;Reports of whom? You wished me not to credit them.
What, Sir, are these reports?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">466</span>
<p><i>Stu.</i> I thought them slander, madam; and cautioned you in friendship;
left from officious tongues the tale had reached you, with double aggravation.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Proceed, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> It is a debt due to my fame, due to an injured wife too&mdash;We
both are injured.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> How injured? and who has injured us?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> My friend, your husband.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> You would resent for both then? But know, Sir, My injuries
are my own, and do not need a champion.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Be not too hasty, madam. I come not in resentment, but for
acquittance. You thought me poor; and to the feigned distresses of a friend
gave up your jewels.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> I gave them to a husband.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Who gave them to a&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> What? Whom did he give them to?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> A mistress.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> No; on my life he did not.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Himself confessed it, with curses on her avarice.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> I'll not believe it. He has no mistress&mdash;or if he
has, why is it told to Me?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> To guard you against insults. He told me, that to move you to
compliance, he forged that letter, pretending I was ruined; ruined by Him too.
The fraud succeeded; and what a trusting wife bestowed in pity, was lavished
on a wanton.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Then I am lost indeed; and my afflictions are too powerful
for me. His follies I have borne without upbraiding, and saw the approach of
poverty without a tear. My affections, my strong affections supported me
through every trial.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Be patient, madam.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">467</span><span class = "folionum">Ooo2</span>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Patient! The barbarous man! And does he think my
tenderness of heart is his security for wounding it? But he shall find that
injuries such as these, can arm my weakness for vengeance and redress.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Ha! then I may succeed. (<i>Aside.</i>) Redress is in your
power.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> What redress?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Forgive me, madam, if in my zeal to serve you, I hazard your
displeasure. Think of your wretched state. Already want surrounds you. Is it
in patience to bear That? To see your helpless little one robbed of his
birth-right? A sister too, with unavailing tears, lamenting her lost fortune?
No comfort left you, but ineffectual pity from the Few, out-weighed by insults
from the Many?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Am I so lost a creature? Well, Sir, my redress?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> To be resolved is to secure it. The marriage vow, once
violated, is in the sight of heaven dissolved&mdash;Start not, but hear me!
'Tis now the summer of your youth; time has not cropt the roses from your
cheek, though sorrow long has washed them. Then use your beauty wisely; and,
freed by injuries, fly from the cruellest of men, for shelter with the
kindest.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> And who is He?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> A friend to the unfortunate; a bold one too; who while the
storm is bursting on your brow, and lightening flashing from your eyes, dares
tell you that he loves you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Would that these eyes had heaven's own lightening! that
with a look, thus I might blast thee! Am I then fallen so low? Has poverty so
humbled me, that I should listen to a hellish offer, and sell my soul for
bread?
<span class = "pagenum">468</span>
O, villain! villain!&mdash;But now I know thee, and thank thee for the
knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> If you are wife, you shall have cause to thank me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> An injured husband too shall thank thee.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Yet know, proud woman, I have a heart as stubborn as your own;
as haughty and imperious: and as it loves, so can it hate.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Mean, despicable villain! I scorn thee, and thy threats.
Was it for this that Beverley was false? That his too credulous wife should in
despair and vengeance give up her honour to a wretch? But he shall know it,
and vengeance shall be his.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Why send him for defiance then. Tell him I love his wife; but
that a worthless husband forbids our union. I'll make a widow of you, and
court you honourably.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> O, coward! coward! thy soul will shrink at him. Yet in the
thought of what may happen, I feel a woman's fears. Keep thy own secret, and
begone. Who's there?</p>

misery. When all was lost, he fixed his eyes upon the ground, and stood some
time, with folded arms, stupid and motionless. Then snatching his sword, that
hung against the wainscot, he sat him down; and with a look of fixt attention,
drew figures on the floor. At last he started up, looked wild, and trembled;

climbing to high fortune, the world had marked you for what you are, a little
paultry villain.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> You think I fear you.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> I know you fear me. This is to prove it. (<i>Pulls him by the

<p><i>Lew.</i> Infamous coward! Why, take it now then&mdash; (<i>Draws, and
Stukely retires.</i>) Alas! I pity thee. Yet that a wretch like this should
overcome a Beverley! it fills me with astonishment! A wretch, so mean of soul,
that even desperation cannot animate him to look upon an enemy. You should not
thus have soared, Sir, unless, like others of your black profession, you had a
sword to keep the fools in awe, your villainy has ruined.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Villainy! 'Twere best to curb this licence of your tongue; for
know, Sir, while there are laws, this outrage on my reputation will not be
borne with.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">474</span>
<p><i>Lew.</i> Laws! Dar'st Thou seek shelter from the laws? those laws, which
thou and thy infernal crew live in the constant violation of? Talk'st thou of
reputation too? when under friendship's sacred name, thou hast betrayed,
robbed, and destroyed?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Ay, rail at gaming; 'tis a rich topic, and affords noble
declamation. Go, preach against it in the city: you'll find a congregation in
every tavern. If they should laugh at you, fly to my lord, and sermonize it
there: he'll thank you and reform.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> And will example sanctify a vice? No, wretch; the custom of my
lord, or of the Cit that apes him, cannot excuse a breach of law, or make the
gamester's calling reputable.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Rail on, I say. But is this zeal for beggared Beverley? Is it
for Him that I am treated thus? No; He and His might all have groaned in
prison, had but the sister's fortune escaped the wreck, to have rewarded the
disinterested love of honest Mr. Lewson.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> How I detest thee for the thought! But thou art lost to every
human feeling. Yet let me tell thee, and may it wring thy heart! that though
my friend is ruined by thy snares, thou hast unknowingly been kind to
Me.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Have I? It was indeed unknowingly.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Thou hast assisted me in love; given me the merit that I
wanted; since but for Thee, my Charlotte had not known 'twas her dear self I
sighed for, and not her fortune.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Thank me, and take her then.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> And as a brother to poor Beverley, I will pursue the robber
that has seized him, and snatch him from his gripe.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Then know, imprudent man, he <i>is</i> within my gripe;

supplied him, shall fall and crush him.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Stay. I must be heard, then answered. Perhaps the motion was
too sudden; and human nature starts at murder, though strong necessity compels
it. I have thought long of this; and my first feelings were like yours; a
foolish conscience awed me, which soon I conquered. The man that would undo
me, nature cries out, undo. Brutes know their foes by instinct; and where
superior force is given, they use it for destruction. Shall man do less?
Lewson pursues us to our ruin; and shall we, with the means to crush him, fly
from our hunter, or turn and tear him? 'Tis folly even to hesitate.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> He has obliged me, and I dare not.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Why, live to shame then, to beggary and punishment. You would
be privy to the deed, yet want the soul to act it. Nay more; had my designs
been levelled at his fortune, you had stept in the foremost. And what is life
without its comforts? Those you would rob him of; and by a lingering death,
add cruelty to murder. Henceforth adieu to half-made villains&mdash;there's
danger in them. What you have got is your's; keep it, and hide with it: I'll
deal my future bounty to those who merit it.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> What's the reward?</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Equal division of our gains. I swear it, and will be just.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> Think of the means then.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> He's gone to Beverley's&mdash; Wait for him in the street&mdash;'tis
a dark night, and fit for mischief. A dagger would be useful.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> He sleeps no more.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Consider the reward! When the deed's done, I have farther
business with you. Send Dawson to me.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> How like an out-cast do I wander! Loaded with every curse, that
drives the soul to desperation! The midnight robber, as he walks his rounds,
sees by the glimmering lamp my frantic looks, and dreads to meet me. Whither
am I going? My home lies there; all that is dear on earth it holds too; yet
are the gates of death more welcome to me. I'll enter it no more&mdash;Who

he has been meddling with my fame.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> So I have heard, Sir; and now must thank you for't.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> To-morrow I may deserve your thanks. Late as it is, I go to
Bates. Discoveries are making that an arch villain trembles at.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Discoveries are made, Sir, that You shall tremble at. Where is
this boasted spirit? this high demeanour, that was to call me to account? You
say I have wronged
<span class = "pagenum">478</span>
my sister&mdash;Now say as much. But first be ready for defence, as I am for
resentment.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>Draws.</i></div>

<p><i>Lew.</i> What mean you? I understand you not.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> The coward's stale acquittance. Who, when he spreads foul
calumny abroad, and dreads just vengeance on him, cries out, what mean you, I
understand you not.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Coward, and calumny! Whence are these words? But I forgive, and
pity you.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Your pity had been kinder to my fame. But you have traduced it;
told a vile story to the public ear, that I have wronged my sister.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> 'Tis false. Shew me the man that dares accuse me.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I thought you brave, and of a soul superior to low malice; but
I have found you, and will have vengeance. This is no place for argument.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Nor shall it be for violence. Imprudent man! who in revenge for
fancied injuries, would pierce the heart that loves him! But honest friendship
acts from itself, unmoved by slander, or ingratitude. The life you thirst for,
shall be employed to serve you.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> 'Tis thus you would compound then! First do a wrong beyond
forgiveness; and to redress it, load me with kindness unsolicited. I'll not
receive it. Your zeal is troublesbme.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> No matter. It shall be useful.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> It will not be accepted.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> It must. You know me not.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Yes; for the slanderer of my fame: who under shew of friendship,
arraigns me of injustice; buzzing in every ear foul breach of trust, and
family dishonour.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Have I done this? Who told you so?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">479</span>
<p><i>Bev.</i> The world. 'Tis talked of everywhere. It pleased you to add
threats too: you were to call me to account &mdash;Why, do it now then; I
shall be proud of such an arbiter.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Put up your sword, and know me better. I never injured you. The
base suggestion comes from Stukely: I see him and his aims.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> What aims? I'll not conceal it; <i>'twas</i> Stukely that
accused you.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> To rid him of an enemy: perhaps of two. He fears discovery, and
frames a tale of falsehood, to ground revenge and murder on.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I must have proof of this.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Wait till to-morrow then.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I will.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> Good night. I go to serve you. Forget what's past, as I do; and
chear your family with smiles. To-morrow may confirm them, and make all
happy.</p>

honour is but another name for pride; which easier bears the consciousness of
guilt, than the world's just reproofs. But 'tis the fashion of the times; and
in defence of falsehood and false honour, men die martyrs. I knew not that my

<p><i>Bev.</i> Continue so, and leave me. My sorrows are contagious. No one is

<p><i>Bev.</i> I tell thee that they will not. Who sent thee hither?</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> My weeping mistress.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Am I so meek a husband then? that a commanding wife prescribes
my hours, and sends to chide me for my absence? Tell her, I'll not return.</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> Those words would kill her.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Kill her! Would they not be kind then? But she shall live to
curse me&mdash;I have deserved it of her. Does she not hate me, Jarvis?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">481</span><span class = "folionum">Qqq</span>

<p><i>Jar.</i> Alas, Sir! Forget your griefs, and let me lead you to her. The
streets are dangerous.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Be wise, and leave me then. The night's black horrors are
suited to my thoughts. These stones shall be my resting-place. (<i>Lies
down.</i>) Here shall my soul brood o'er its miseries; till with the fiends of
hell, and guilty of the earth, I start and tremble at the morning's light.</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> For pity's sake, Sir!&mdash;Upon my knees I beg you to quit
this place, and these sad thoughts. Let patience, not despair, possess you.
Rise, I beseech you. There's not a moment of your absence, that my poor
mistress does not groan for.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Have I undone her, and is she still so kind? (<i>Starting
up</i>) It is too much&mdash;My brain can't hold it&mdash;O, Jarvis! Jarvis!
how desperate is that wretch's state, which only death or madness can
relieve!</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> Appease his mind, good heaven! and give him resignation! Alas,
Sir, could beings in the other world perceive the events of this, how would
your parents' blessed spirits grieve for you, even in heaven! Let me conjure
you by Their honoured memories; by the sweet innocence of your yet helpless
child, and by the ceaseless sorrows of my poor mistress, to rouze your
manhood, and struggle with these griefs.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Thou virtuous, good old man! thy tears and thy entreaties have
reached my heart, through all its miseries. O! had I listened to Thy honest
warnings, no earthly blessing had been wanting to me! I was so happy, that
even a wish for more than I possessed, was arrogant presumption. But I have
warred against the power that blest me, and now am sentenced to the hell I
merit.</p>

<p><i>Daw.</i> No. We walked together; and sheltered by the darkness, saw
Beverley and Lewson in warm debate. But soon they cooled; and then I left
them, to hasten hither; but not till 'twas resolved Lewson should die.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Thy words have given me life. That quarrel too was fortunate;
for if my hopes deceive me not, it promises a grave to Beverley.</p>

<p><i>Daw.</i> You misconceive me. Lewson and he were friends.</p>

he falls by Beverley: an upright jury shall decree it. Ask me no questions,

<p><i>Bates.</i> By his own door; he was leading me to his house. I pretended
business with him, and stabbed him to the heart, while he was reaching at the
bell.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> And did he fall so suddenly?</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> The repetition pleases you, I see. I told you, he fell
without a groan.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> What heard you of him this morning?</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> That the watch found him in their rounds, and alarmed the
servants. I mingled with the crowd just now, and saw him dead in his own
house. The sight terrified me.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Away with terrors, till his ghost rise and accuse us. We have

<p><i>Stu.</i> Good. We'll talk of this presently. The women were with him, I

your thoughts were too busy. 'Tis well you have a heart of stone, the tale
would melt it else.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> Out with it then.</p>

<p><i>Daw.</i> I traced him to his lodgings; and pretending pity for his
misfortunes, kept the door open, while the officers seized him. 'Twas a damned
deed&mdash;but no matter&mdash;I followed my instructions.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> And what said he?</p>

<p><i>Daw.</i> He upbraided me with treachery, called You a villain,
acknowledged the sums you had lent him, and submitted to his fortune.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> And the women&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Daw.</i> For a few minutes astonishment kept them silent. They looked
wildly at one another, while the tears streamed down their cheeks. But rage
and fury soon gave them words; and then, in the very bitterness of despair,
they cursed me, and the monster that had employed me.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> And you bore it with philosophy?</p>

<p><i>Daw.</i> Till the scene changed, and then I melted. I ordered the
officers to take away their prisoner. The women shrieked, and would have
followed him; but We forbad them. 'Twas then they fell upon their knees, the
wife fainting, the sister raving, and both, with all the eloquence of misery,
endeavouring to soften us. I never felt compassion till that moment; and had
the officers been moved like Me, we had left the business undone, and fled
with curses on ourselves. But their hearts were steeled by
<span class = "pagenum">486</span>
custom: the tears of beauty, and the pangs of affection, were beneath their
pity. They tore him from their arms, and lodged him in prison, with only
Jarvis to comfort him.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> There let him lie, till we have farther business with him. And
for You, Sir, let me hear no more of your compassion. A fellow nursed in
villainy, and employed from childhood in the business of hell, should have no
dealings with compassion.</p>

<p><i>Daw.</i> Say you so, Sir? You should have named the devil that tempted
me.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> 'Tis false. I found you a villain; therefore employed
you&mdash;But no more of this&mdash;We have embarked too far in mischief to
recede. Lewson is dead; and we are all principals in his murder. Think of
that. There's time enough for pity, when ourselves are out of danger. Beverley
still lives, though in a jail. His ruin will sit heavy on him; and discoveries
may be made to undo us all. Something must be done, and speedily. You saw him
quarrelling with Lewson in the street last night?</p>
<div class = "stagedir">[<i>To Bates.</i></div>

<p><i>Bates.</i> I did; his steward, Jarvis, saw him too.</p>

<p><i>Stu.</i> And shall attest it. Here's matter to work upon. An unwilling
evidence carries weight with him. Something of my design I have hinted t'you
before. Beverley must be the author of this murder; and We the parties to
convict him. But how to proceed, will require time and thought&mdash;Come

he pass the night, Jarvis?</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> Why now, madam, I can tell you. Like a man dreaming of death
and horrors. When they led him to his cell&mdash;for 'twas a poor apartment
for my master&mdash;he flung himself upon a wretched bed, and lay speechless
till day-break. A sigh now and then, and a few tears that followed those
sighs, were all that told me he was alive. I spoke to him, but he would not
hear me; and when I persisted, he raised his hand at me, and knit his brow
so&mdash;I thought he would have struck me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> O miserable! But what said he, Jarvis? Or was he silent
all night?</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> At day-break he started from the bed, and looking wildly at me,
asked who I was. I told him, and bid him be of comfort&mdash;Begone, old
wretch, says he&mdash;I have sworn never to know comfort&mdash;My wife! my
child! my sister! I have undone them all, and will know no comfort&mdash;Then
letting go his hold, and falling upon his knees, he imprecated curses on
himself.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> This is too horrible!&mdash;But you did not leave him
so?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> No, I am sure he did not.</p>

<p><i>Jar.</i> I had not the heart, madam. By degrees I brought him to
himself. A shower of tears came to his relief; and then he called me his
kindest friend, and begged forgiveness
<span class = "pagenum">490</span>
of me like a child&mdash;I was a child too, when he begged forgiveness of me;
my heart throbbed so, I could not speak to him. He turned from me for a minute
or two, and suppressing a few bitter sighs, enquired after his wretched
family&mdash;Wretched was his word, madam&mdash;Asked how you bore the misery
of last night&mdash;If you had goodness enough to see him in prison&mdash;And
then begged me to hasten to you. I told him he must be more himself first&mdash;He
promised me he would; and, bating a few sullen intervals, he became composed
and easy. And then I left him; but not without an attendant; a servant in the

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Alas! what tale is this? And why are we to curse you? I'll
bless you for ever.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> No; I have deserved no blessings. The world holds not such
another wretch. All this large fortune, this second bounty of heaven, that
might have healed our sorrows, and satisfied our utmost hopes, in a curst hour
I sold last night.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Sold! How sold?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Impossible! It cannot be!</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> That devil Stukely, with all hell to aid him, tempted me to the
deed. To pay false debts of honour, and to redeem past errors, I sold the
reversion&mdash;sold it for a scanty sum, and lost it among villains.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Why, farewel all then.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Liberty and life. Come, kneel and curse me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Then hear me heaven! (<i>Kneels</i>) Look down with mercy
on his sorrows! Give softness to his looks, and quiet to his heart! Take from
his memory the sense of what is past, and cure him of despair! On Me, on Me,
if misery must be the lot of either, multiply misfortunes! I'll bear them
patiently, so He is happy! These hands shall toil for his support! These eyes

<div class = "stagedir">[<i>Rises.</i></div>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I would kneel too, but that offended heaven would turn my

Is it for length of days that I should kneel? No; My time is limited. Or is it
for this world's blessings upon You and Yours? To pour out my heart in wishes
for a ruined wife, a child and sister? O! no! For I have done a deed to make
you miserable.</p>

deed is done.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> While shame and punishment shall rack that viper. (<i>Pointing

therefore doomed to die. Bates, to prevent the murder, undertook it. I kept
aloof to give it credit&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> And gave Me pangs unutterable.</p>

<p><i>Lew.</i> I felt them all, and would have told you; but vengeance wanted
ripening. The villain's scheme was but half executed. The arrest by Dawson
followed the supposed murder: and now, depending on his once wicked associates,
he comes to fix the guilt on Beverley.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> O! execrable wretch!</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> Dawson and I are witnesses of this.</p>

false dice; and Stukely sole contriver, and possessor of all.</p>

still.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> Thus heaven turns evil into good; and by permitting sin,
warns men to virtue.</p>

death. But death were mercy. Shame, beggary, and imprisonment, unpitied
misery, the stings of conscience, and the curses of mankind shall make life

<p><i>Bev.</i> For meanly dying.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> No&mdash;do not say it.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> As truly as my soul must answer it. Had Jarvis staid this
morning, all had been well. But pressed by shame; pent in a prison; tormented
with my pangs for You; driven to despair and madness; I took the advantage of
his absence, corrupted the poor wretch he left to guard me, and&mdash;swallowed
poison.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bev.</i> O! fatal deed!</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Dreadful and cruel!</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Ay, most accursed&mdash;And now I go to my account. This rest
from pain brings death; yet 'tis heaven's kindness to me. I wished for ease, a
moment's ease, that cool repentance and contrition might soften vengeance.
Bend me, and let me kneel. (<i>They lift him from his chair, and support him
on his knees</i>) I'll pray for You too. Thou Power that mad'st me, hear me!
If for a life of frailty, and this too hasty deed of death, thy justice dooms
me, here I acquit the sentence. But if, enthroned in mercy where thou sitt'st,
thy pity has beheld me, send me a gleam of hope; that in these last and bitter
moments, my soul may taste of comfort! And for these mourners here, O! let
their lives be peaceful, and their deaths happy! Now raise me.</p>

Yet heaven is gracious. I asked for hope, as the

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
